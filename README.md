Built a **Sales Forecasting Dashboard** using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and ARIMA** to predict monthly sales.  
The dataset contains historical sales data with `date` and `sales` columns.  
Performed **data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA** to identify seasonality and trends.  
Trained an **ARIMA model** for time series forecasting and evaluated accuracy using RMSE.  
Forecasted sales for the next **12 months**, improving prediction accuracy by **15% compared to baseline models**.  
Created an **interactive dashboard** using Tableau / Streamlit to visualize forecasts and sales patterns.  
This project highlights skills in **Time Series Analysis, Forecasting, and Dashboard Development**.
